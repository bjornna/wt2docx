* Glucose [Moles/volume] in Capillary blood by Glucometer (LOINC: 14743-9)


*Description*: Name of the laboratory investigation performed on the specimen(s).



*comment*: A test result may be for a single analyte, or a group of items, including panel tests. It is strongly recommended that 'Test name' be coded with a terminology, for example LOINC or SNOMED CT. For example: 'Glucose', 'Urea and Electrolytes', 'Swab', 'Cortisol (am)', 'Potassium in perspiration' or 'Melanoma histopathology'. The name may sometimes include specimen type and patient state, for example 'Fasting blood glucose' or include other information, as 'Potassium (PNA blood gas)'.

*comment*: The value for this element is normally supplied in a specialisation, in a template or at run-time to reflect the actual analyte. For example: 'Serum sodium', 'Haemoglobin'. Coding with an external terminology is strongly recommended, such as LOINC, NPU, SNOMED CT, or local lab terminologies.

The 'Any' data type will need to be constrained to an appropriate data type in a specialisation, a template or at run-time to reflect the actual analyte result. The Quantity data type has reference model attributes that include flags for normal/abnormal, reference ranges and approximations - see https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/data_types.html#_dv_quantity_class for more details.

* VDRL (LOINC: LOINC4)

*Description*: Name of the laboratory investigation performed on the specimen(s).



*comment*: A test result may be for a single analyte, or a group of items, including panel tests. It is strongly recommended that 'Test name' be coded with a terminology, for example LOINC or SNOMED CT. For example: 'Glucose', 'Urea and Electrolytes', 'Swab', 'Cortisol (am)', 'Potassium in perspiration' or 'Melanoma histopathology'. The name may sometimes include specimen type and patient state, for example 'Fasting blood glucose' or include other information, as 'Potassium (PNA blood gas)'.

*Description*: The value of the analyte result.



*comment*: For example '7.3 mmol/l', 'Raised'. The 'Any' data type will need to be constrained to an appropriate data type in a specialisation, a template or at run-time to reflect the actual analyte result. The Quantity data type has reference model attributes that include flags for normal/abnormal, reference ranges and approximations - see https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/data_types.html#_dv_quantity_class for more details.

*Description*: Name of the laboratory investigation performed on the specimen(s).



*comment*: A test result may be for a single analyte, or a group of items, including panel tests. It is strongly recommended that 'Test name' be coded with a terminology, for example LOINC or SNOMED CT. For example: 'Glucose', 'Urea and Electrolytes', 'Swab', 'Cortisol (am)', 'Potassium in perspiration' or 'Melanoma histopathology'. The name may sometimes include specimen type and patient state, for example 'Fasting blood glucose' or include other information, as 'Potassium (PNA blood gas)'.

The 'Any' data type will need to be constrained to an appropriate data type in a specialisation, a template or at run-time to reflect the actual analyte result. The Quantity data type has reference model attributes that include flags for normal/abnormal, reference ranges and approximations - see https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/data_types.html#_dv_quantity_class for more details.
